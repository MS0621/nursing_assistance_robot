# üè• Nursing Assistant Autonomous Robot System  

## 1. üìå Project Overview

To address the excessive workload and burnout of nurses in hospital settings, we developed an autonomous robotic system that automates **medication delivery** and **vital sign monitoring**.

The system consists of **two TurtleBot4 robots** working cooperatively to perform logistics and patient interaction tasks across the **pharmacy and ward areas** in a hospital-like environment.

### ‚úÖ Contactless Vital Sign Monitoring
- rPPG-based estimation of heart rate, SpO2, and blood pressure

 < What is rPPG? >

rPPG is a non-contact method for measuring vital signs using a standard RGB camera. Based on the principles of traditional PPG, it detects subtle changes in facial skin color caused by blood volume variations to estimate physiological signals.

  1. Remote and non-invasive heart rate monitoring

  2. Analyzes minute skin tone changes from facial video

  3. Can measure: heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, stress levels, blood pressure, and skin temperature

- Integrated with face tracking and signal enhancement filters

### ‚úÖ Cloud-Based Robot Communication
- MQTT messaging over EMQX Cloud for stable multi-robot coordination
